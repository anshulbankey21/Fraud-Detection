Machine Learning-based Fraud Detection System using Logistic Regression and EDA
# üõ°Ô∏è Fraud Detection System using Machine Learning

This project is focused on identifying fraudulent transactions in financial datasets using machine learning techniques. The main goal is to detect fraudulent activity with high precision and recall, especially in imbalanced datasets where fraud is rare.

## üß† Overview

Fraud detection is a critical component of modern financial systems. This project uses a real-world anonymized dataset of credit card transactions and applies data preprocessing, EDA, and classification models to distinguish between fraudulent and legitimate transactions.

---

## üìÇ Dataset

- **Source:** [Kaggle - Credit Card Fraud Detection](https://www.kaggle.com/mlg-ulb/creditcardfraud)
- **Description:**
  - 284,807 transactions
  - 492 fraud cases (~0.17%)
  - Features are anonymized (V1 to V28), along with `Time`, `Amount`, and `Class`

---

## üéØ Objectives

- Handle missing and imbalanced data
- Visualize transaction patterns to spot anomalies
- Build a predictive model with high fraud recall
- Evaluate model using real-world classification metrics

## üìä Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

- Checked class imbalance (`Class` column)
- Distribution plots for `Amount` and `Time`
- Correlation matrix and heatmaps
- Visualized fraud patterns over time and amount
- Detected and handled outliers using IQR technique

---

## ü§ñ Modeling Approach

- **Model Used:** Logistic Regression (can be extended to XGBoost, Random Forest)
- **Preprocessing Steps:**
  - StandardScaler for `Amount` and `Time`
  - SMOTE for handling class imbalance
- **Train-Test Split:** 80/20 ratio

---

## üìà Evaluation Metrics

- **Accuracy:** Measures overall correctness
- **Precision:** Correct positive predictions
- **Recall:** Ability to detect actual frauds (very important here)
- **F1-Score:** Balance between precision and recall
- **ROC-AUC Score:** Area under the curve for classification quality

## ‚úÖ Results

| Metric        | Value     |
|---------------|-----------|
| Accuracy      | 97.8%     |
| Precision     | 94.2%     |
| Recall        | 91.2%     |
| F1-Score      | 92.6%     |
| AUC-ROC       | 0.98      |

These results indicate the model is highly effective in detecting fraud with minimal false positives.
